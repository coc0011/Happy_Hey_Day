# Happy_Hey_Day

> Hey Day is an Auburn tradition that dates back to the mid 1940s. Once a year, students, faculty, and everyone else in the Auburn family celebrate Hey Day by wearing name tags and saying "Hey!" to everyone they come across that day. This lighthearted communication encourages a happy, friendly atmosphere and strengthens the already powerful Auburn spirit. Here is some additional information about [Hey Day](https://sga.auburn.edu/hey-day/).

### Steps to make your own Hey Day Script
1. First, use the `echo` command to create a statement that will print out to the user.
   
    * This should be the line that asks or instructs the user to enter their name.
  
    * Don't forget to use quotes to enclose the statement!
  
      
2. Next, use the command `read` to save the input as a variable, follwed by the varibale name.

     * Here, I called the variable **name**.
  
3. Then, use another echo statement to print the desired satement (Hey, ), and use a $ to _call_ the varibale created in step two.

     * The product should resemble `echo "Hey, $name!"`


### Results
Now, the computer should be able to tell you Hey!
